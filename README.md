## 🚑 What's Inside?

- **Doctor's Diary**: Keep track of all those patients who insist on WebMD-ing their symptoms before they come in.

- **Admin Arena**: For the brave souls who handle the paperwork, scheduling, and those tricky insurance claims.
- **Patient Portal**: Because who doesn't love filling out forms online? Get your patients onboard and let them schedule their own appointments.
